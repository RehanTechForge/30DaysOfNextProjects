# 30 Days of 30 Projects: Next.js Edition

Welcome to my ambitious journey through 30 projects in 30 days using Next.js! This README will serve as a central document detailing each project, starting with the Countdown Timer and including future projects as they are developed.

## Completed Projects

### Project 1: Countdown Timer

**Description:**  
The Countdown Timer is a robust and user-friendly application developed with Next.js and TypeScript, designed to help users efficiently track upcoming events or deadlines. Users can easily set a target date and time, and the app will dynamically display a real-time countdown.

The responsive design guarantees an optimal experience across both desktop and mobile devices.

**Features:**
- Start, pause, and reset functionalities for flexible countdown management.
- Real-time countdown updates.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.

**Technologies Used:**

- Next.js for the framework
